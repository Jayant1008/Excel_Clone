# Excel Clone  

A simple spreadsheet application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It supports editing cells, writing formulas (like `=A1 + B2`), applying styles (bold, italic, underline, alignment, colors), and automatically updating dependent cells (including transitive dependencies).  

---

## Features  

### Cell Editing  
- Directly type values into cells.  
- If a cell already had a formula, editing clears it and makes the cell independent.  

### Formulas  
- Supports formulas like:  
  - `A1 + B1`  
  - `A1 * 2`  
  - `( A1 + B1 ) * 3`  
- References other cells using their Excel-style address (`A1`, `B2`, etc.).  
- Uses `eval()` to calculate arithmetic expressions once references are replaced with values.  

### Styling  
- Each cell supports text formatting and styles:  
  - Font family (for example: Arial)  
  - Font size  
  - Bold, italic, underline  
  - Horizontal alignment (left, center, right)  
  - Text color  
  - Background color  

### Dependency Tracking  
- Each cell keeps track of its children (cells depending on it).  
- When a cell changes:  
  - Its value is updated.  
  - All dependent cells are recalculated recursively (supports transitive updates).  
- Example:  
  - `B1 = A1 + 5`  
  - `C1 = B1 * 2`  
  - Updating `A1` ‚Üí updates `B1` ‚Üí updates `C1`.  

### Formula Removal  
- If a cell with a formula is edited directly, its formula is removed.  
- Dependencies are cleared from parent cells.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack  

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS  
- **Logic:** JavaScript (Vanilla, no frameworks)  
- **Data Model:**  
  Each cell stores the following information:  
  - Text color  
  - Background color  
  - Font family  
  - Font size  
  - Horizontal alignment  
  - Bold, italic, underline states  
  - Value of the cell  
  - Formula (if any)  
  - List of dependent children cells

## ‚ö° How It Works  

### Cell Input (Blur Event)  
- When a user types in a cell and leaves it:  
  - If the value is the same ‚Üí nothing changes.  
  - If a formula existed ‚Üí it is removed.  
- The cell‚Äôs value is updated, and all dependent children update recursively.  

### Formula Input (Enter Key)  
- User enters a formula in the formula bar and presses Enter.  
- Formula is parsed:  
  - Cell references (`A1`, `B2`, ‚Ä¶) are replaced with values.  
  - Expression is evaluated using `eval`.  
- Dependencies are registered in parent cells.  
- Value is updated and propagated.  

### Update Propagation  
- `updateUI()` updates the current cell‚Äôs value in both the UI and the database.  
- Recursively updates all child cells that depend on it.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations

- Only supports basic arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `()`.  
- No built-in Excel functions (`SUM`, `AVERAGE`, etc.).  
- No support for ranges (like `A1:A5`).  
- No circular dependency detection (e.g., `A1 = B1 + 1` and `B1 = A1 + 1` will loop).
